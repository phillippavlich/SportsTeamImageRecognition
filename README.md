# SportsTeamImageRecognition
This project involves building an android app in Android Studio which can either take a picture of a 
sports team logo or upload a sports team logo. Then, with that image, the program uses breaks down the 
image to be analyzed by a series of experts. One expert analyzes the color breakdown to make an informed 
decision on what sports team logo it is. The other experts analyzes text patterns in the image and guesses 
the sports team logo according to that data. Combining these experts, we get a good guess at what sports 
team logo is located in the picture. The program returns details about the team. A shape expert is being 
developed to look into shapes that are present across the images during the image recognition process.
